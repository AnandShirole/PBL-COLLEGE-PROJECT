# PBL-COLLEGE-PROJECT
The main objective of  Library Management System is developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of the library. It has two sides – User side (student / teacher).  Admin side. Only registered users can get every facility of this website. They can log in to their account and see their personal information and modify them. They can search for a book by the name or search it in a particular department. They can easily order a book. After the admin approve it they can see the issue and return date beside the book name. An automatic timer will set up on the user’s id. It’ll show how much time left until the return date.
